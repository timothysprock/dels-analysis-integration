# Analysis Integration for Discrete Event Logistics Systems

## Overview
A discrete event logistics system (or DELS) can be described as:

•	a network of resources, arranged in a facility; each resource has one or more processing capabilities and for each capability, it has a capacity; 

•	a set of products flow through this network of resources, and are transformed by processes executed by the resources; a process may require the capabilities of more than one resource; the transformation can change location, age, or condition

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop abstractions and methodologies to integrate systems models with analysis models and tools, such as discrete event simulation. The target analysis toolboxes currently include:

•	Multi-commodity flow network (MCFN) & facility location via Math Programming tools (such as CPLEX)

•	Queueing Network analysis

•	Newsvendor Networks

•	Discrete Event Simulation - using SimEvents

•	Simulation Optimization - using Genetic Algorithms
